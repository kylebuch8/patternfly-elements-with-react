              <p>
                There is legislation that decides what you can conjure and what
                you can not. Because things that you conjure out of thin air
                will not last, it is illegal in the wizarding world.

              <p>
                <a href="#">The characters in the portraits</a> are not actually
                ghosts. They mainly are there just to repeat common phrases or

                they depict. A portrait of his parents would not be of much help
                to Harry.

                Because Harry's grandparents were not able to do magic. This is
                generally frowned upon by those who consider themselves pure,
                such as the Malfoy's or other antagonists.

                No! It has been revealed that there are actually 11 long
                established and prestigious schools around the globe. These
                include Castelobruxo in the rainforest of Brazil, Durmstrang
                Institute (whereas nobody is certain of itâ€™s whereabouts), and
                Ilvermorny, right here in the United States.

                very well. Ginny becomes a professional Quidditch player and
                then sportswriter for the Daily Prophet.
